I have an existing web app in https://github.com/mickoscode/surf-club-signin/blob/main/app/index.template.html

I will have multiple html template files in my project, 
in both the app and app-test folders. See https://github.com/mickoscode/surf-club-signin/tree/main/app

I want each html template page to include a slim menu header 
at the top of the page. 
The menu header should have a black background, with white 
underlined text for links. 

The menu header should be a bar or row, split into 3 sections. 
The left section should:
- align text to the left
- underline text
- include the word "sign", which links to ./index.html

The middle section should:
- align text to center
- no underline
- include the word "youth", with no link

The right section should:
- align text to the right
- underline text
- include the word "live", which links to ./live.html

Ideally the header would be defined in a separate file called header.snippet
And this html snippet would be inserted into the relevant section of the 
existing html template files, or simply included.

Please generate an example header.snippet so that it is valid html, but does not contain head or body sections.

And please suggest modern best method practice to then include this 
snippet into the template files, without having to use a heavy weight framework.

Please ensure the same style sheet, sizes and naming conventions are used as the existing web page https://github.com/mickoscode/surf-club-signin/blob/main/app/index.template.html

The menu-header needs to span the full width of the page, as it will be
displayed on mobile devices, it also needs to be responsive to different 
form factors and sizes.
