        <p>
            This is a simple sign-in-out application designed for <b>Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club</b>.<br />
            <br />
            It allows members to easily log their attendance for activities, starting with <b>Youth Sunday Sessions</b>.<br />
            The intention is to provide an extremely simple electronic replacement of the traditional paper sign-in sheets.<br />
            <br />
            If this application is useful, it may be possible to extend it's use to Nippers or other activities.<br />
            Please speak with <b>Mick O'Connor</b> if you would like to discuss this further. <br />
        </p>
        <h1 id="about-how">How the app works</h1>
        <p>
            Currently, the sign-in-out forms can only be used on Sunday mornings, during standard Youth/Nipper session times.<br />
            i.e.<br /> 
            Sign <b>in</b> is accessible from 8:00am to 9.30am<br />
            Sign <b>out</b> is accessible from 9:31am to 10:40am.<br />
            <br />
            Youth simply enter their name and click the "Sign In/Out" button.<br />
            Only registed Youth will be able to sign in. Unrecognised names will be rejected.<br />
            <br />
            Age Managers have addiitonal features to see <b>live</b> number of sign-ins, historical data, etc.<br />
            Again, these features are only available during standard Youth/Nipper session times.<br />
        </p>
        <h1 id="about-faq">FAQ</h1>
        <h3>I am a registered memember, but my name is not listed (or is incorrect)</h3>
        Please use paper sign-in backup, and discuss with Age Managers, so missing/incorrect name can be corrected.<br />
        <h3>I would like some extra features added to the app - e.g. tracking profeciencies/awards, etc</h3>
        This is not the purpose of the app... but if used successfully for sign-in-out, then perhaps this could be considered in future.<br />
        <h3>I am an Age Manager and I incorrectly signed someone in/out - how can I delete/correct this?</h3>
        Currently, there is no way to delete data... please be more careful :D<br />
        The ability to delete/edit data will be added in the future.<br />
        <h3>The site currently says the next session is this weekend, but the season is over!</h3>
        The sign-in-out application is not aware of the season dates... it simply assumes that sessions are every Sunday.<br />
        Please ignore the "Next Session" message when the season is over and during xmas break :)<br />
